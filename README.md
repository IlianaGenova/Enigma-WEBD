# Enigma-WEBD

### A school project hosted on [Vercel](https://enigma-machine-info-site.now.sh/)

A site to explain the perfect complexity of the Enigma machine in details.

If you're interested, check out my Enigma project [here](https://www.tuesfest.bg/projects/25)
It was made with plenty of help from TUES :)

Detailed presentation could also be found on the upper link.
